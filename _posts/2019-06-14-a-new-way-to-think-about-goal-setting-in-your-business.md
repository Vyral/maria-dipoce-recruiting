Too often, I see agents struggling with their goals. Why is that? Well, many agents fail to give careful consideration to the daily activities that have to occur between the time they set their goals and the point at which they’re achieved.&nbsp;

**Here at Keller Williams, we put a simple, yet effective, goal-setting model called “Four Conversations” into action.** Those four conversations are the business activities to which we, as agents, need to devote time, effort, and thought. These include **listing appointments, listings taken, closings, and profit.**

As simple as it sounds, those four conversations have directly tied into the goals I’ve personally set over the course of my real estate career. &nbsp;

**Think of each conversation as one door leading to the next.** That is to say, if you’re not seeing enough profit, it means you’re not doing enough closings. If you’re not doing enough closings, you don’t have enough listings, and if you don’t have enough listings, it means you need to increase the activity with which you operate when you go on appointments.&nbsp;

When I’m conversing with agents, a lot of them express their desire to earn $100,000 a year. I decided to run the numbers to see what kind of activity it would take to realize this goal, and I found that you’d need to close two deals a month, have two listings taken, and go on around four appointments each and every month of the year.&nbsp;

If you’d like to schedule a one-on-one appointment or webinar with me to discuss how you can set and reach your goals in your business, please let me know. I look forward to hearing from you\!
