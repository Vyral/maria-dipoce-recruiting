Our business is ever-changing thanks to the technological shift we’re moving toward. The fundamental question before us is, “How will it continue affecting the way we run our businesses?”

We consider the times we’re living in right now as the **Fourth Industrial Revolution**, and it’s taking shape through advances in artificial intelligence and “big data.” When those two things converge, you get an individualized customer experience.&nbsp;

This touches many areas of our lives: Your Netflix home screen looks different than mine, for example. When each of us logs into our account, our respective experiences are different. That customizable experience is a major reason why we come back for more.

With that mind, I want to close by asking you two questions: **How are you delivering a Netflix-style experience to your clients?&nbsp;**

And secondly, **what does your brokerage have planned to help your business survive and thrive during this Fourth Industrial Revolution? &nbsp;** &nbsp;

If you have any questions or if you’d like to request a one-on-one coaching session with me, please get in touch. I’d love to have a conversation with you\!
