As a Keller Williams Realty agent, I recently had the pleasure of being able to participate in “Red Day”—Keller Williams’ annual day of service. The point of Red Day is to renew, energize, and donate to wherever we spend our time as real estate agents. For me, that means the Dallas Metroplex, and today I’ll show you a video of our whole team in action at the Austin Street Center. We had an absolute blast handing out donations and doing other service work, and I hope you enjoy the footage as much as I enjoyed making it.
