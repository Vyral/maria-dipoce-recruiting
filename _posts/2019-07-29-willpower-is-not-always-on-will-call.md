Today I want to emphasize a point related to agent productivity: Willpower is not always on will-call.

What do I mean by that? Let me explain.

Think of your willpower like the battery in your phone. You start your day with your battery in the green, you have energy, and the world is your oyster. However, **each time that you make withdrawals from your willpower, your “battery” runs lower and lower.** Before you know it, you’re in the red.

Willpower is different for everybody, but statistics show that people are most productive in the first three to four hours of the day. **This is the best time to get all your lead generation activities out of the way**; that way, you know that by the time you start winding down, you’ll already have those done.

Here at Keller Williams, **we refer to a book called “The One Thing.”** This book is a guide to making sure that we’re working on the one thing that could propel our business forward. “Willpower is not always on will-call” is a phrase and a lesson that I learned from “The One Thing.” Now that I know it, I always like to share it with others to help them improve in both life and business.

If you find this as interesting as I do and would like to talk about it more, or if you’d like to schedule a consultation with me so we can determine if you’re working on your ‘one thing,’ feel free to reach out to me. I’d love to schedule a one-on-one coaching call with you. I hope to hear from you soon.
