As real estate agents, there are three things you need to thrive in this industry. We like to call these things “the three L’s.”

The first “L” stands for leads, i.e. potential clients. No matter if you’re doing $2 million in production or $10 million, you need leads to succeed.&nbsp;

And, of course, you also need listings—as signified by our second “L”. Listings are king in real estate because if you have listings, you have our third “L”: leverage.&nbsp;

Leads bring you listings, and listings bring you leverage. So **if you struggle with any one of these areas, both other areas of your business will suffer. It’s all about balance.&nbsp;**

If any of these problems sound familiar to you, please reach out to me. I would love to coach you on how to put your three L’s back in sync for your business.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
