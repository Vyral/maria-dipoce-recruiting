We all think about our daily mindset like it’s something you either have or you don’t have. I challenge you to think about it this way:

If, for example, you decided to commit to your physical fitness because you want to lose weight or feel better about yourself, you have to make a regular commitment to go to the gym, hire a personal trainer, and change the activities you’re doing with respect to your goals. If you want to look and feel better, you’ll need to exercise and consume a healthy diet.

**Those who are truly committed will undergo these changes and reap the benefits.** However, those who aren’t truly committed and/or can’t make these changes won’t benefit.

Our mindset in real estate is a lot like physical fitness in this way: We have to make a daily commitment to feed our brain more good than the world is trying to feed it bad. This matters in real estate because **your attitude determines your activities.**

So if you don’t do a ‘mindset workout’ every single day and you pick up the phone at 9 a.m. to start lead generating, are you going to be willing to call those people who intimidate you? Or are you only going to call those people you know will already answer their phone, but might not have anything substantial to say?

**To get my daily mindset workout in, I watch YouTube videos, TED Talks, and read books about improving my mindset**—anything that dispels negativity in my life and promotes positivity so that I can have a more productive day.

If you find any of this advice beneficial, I would love to sit down with you to do a one-on-one coaching session to help you work through some of these issues that you’re having with your mindset. Don’t hesitate to reach out to me\!
