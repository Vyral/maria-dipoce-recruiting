We are in a crazy, competitive seller’s market right now. Although I know there are homes that are sitting on the market a little bit longer than normal, there’s a little sweet spot in the $200,000 to $300,000 price range where sellers will still get multiple offers on their homes.

With all the competition that homebuyers are sure to face in that price range, today I want to share a few pointers that will help ensure that your offer is the winning offer.&nbsp;

**1\. Call the listing agent before you show the property.** If they don’t answer the phone (which happens often), then send them a text message to let them know that you have a buyer who is ready, able, and willing to come view the property and who will follow through to closing if you submit an offer.

**2\. Have the representative loan officer reach out to the listing agent.** The loan officer can pass on the message to the listing agent that your buyers are pre-qualified, pre-approved, and all-around solid candidates for the home purchase.

**3\. Make sure to lead with the seller’s best interests.** When speaking with the listing agent, make sure that you’re getting what is important to the seller. A lot of times, agents assume that the seller is all about the price, but many times price has nothing to do with it; it could instead be about terms or timing. Or perhaps they’re looking for a seller leaseback—does your buyer have the time to allow the seller to stay in the property for a few more days after closing to make sure that the seller has time to leave?&nbsp;

There are a lot of moving parts when it comes to submitting a winning offer. We just want to make sure that you’re doing good work on the front end so that your buyer’s offer is accepted and you look like a rockstar to your clients.

If you have any questions about crafting a winning offer, please reach out to me. I’d love to have a one-on-one consultation with you.
