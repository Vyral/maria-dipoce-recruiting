Today, I’ve got an important question for my fellow agents: Do you really see yourself as the CEO of your business? If you aren’t picturing yourself as a leader in your own career, then something is amiss. Running your business like an agent, instead of like a CEO, means that you aren’t making decisions the same way a leader would. Allow me to explain:

When you’re operating your business as an agent, your main concerns are going to be with the day-to-day activities of real estate, like answering phone calls. **You’ll ultimately find yourself stuck in the “whirlwind” of your business.&nbsp;**

When you run your business like a CEO, your focus will be on the big picture. Agents who run their businesses like a CEO create sustainable systems and powerful brands, which are crucial to long-term success. People who run their businesses like agents, meanwhile, will consistently struggle to stay afloat.

**So, how are you running your business?**

If you aren’t already running your business like a CEO, or even if you are, I’d love to have a conversation about your goals and strategies. It would be my pleasure to help guide you toward improving your career.

So, as always, if you have any questions or would like more information, don’t hesitate to reach out. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
