*Find out what you can do to compete with discount brokerages.*

I talk to a lot of you on a weekly basis, and one thing we commonly discuss is, what is going on in the industry, what’s with all the discount brokerages suddenly appearing, and what can I do to make sure that I stay relevant in the conversation and my commissions don’t go away?&nbsp;

FYI: This is an extremely relevant topic that you and your brokerage should be discussing because your commissions fund your life, they fund every bill you pay.

**The way I believe we are going to be able to compete with discount brokerages is by being more deliberate with how we connect to our database.** We have to come up with a way to consistently touch our database. Not only that, but also be aware of the fact that our clients don’t want to know what’s going on with home values all over the area, but what’s going on with the values in their specific neighborhood. When did the house next to them sell, and what did it sell for? We call this hyperlocal information.&nbsp;

If you want to know how Keller Williams is helping their agents methodically market to their databases and become hyperlocal real estate agents, then **schedule a time for us to sit down for 30 minutes and I will do what I’m calling “Extreme Makeover: Your Business.”** Together we will come up with a plan on how you are going to be able to directly compete with discount brokerages, and not have to lower your commissions any further.&nbsp;

If you have further questions or want to discuss anything concerning real estate, please give me a call or send me an email, I would love to speak with you.
