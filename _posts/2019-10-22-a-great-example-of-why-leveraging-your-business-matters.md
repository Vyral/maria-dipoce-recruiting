*Why does leveraging your business matter? Today I’ll explain.*

I first started in this industry about 10 years ago. When I was three transactions into my real estate career, I went to my broker and said, “You know what? This isn’t working out. I picked the wrong career path.”

Of course, he was shocked because those three transactions occurred all within of a month and a half. He told me, “Maria, you’re great at this\! Why do you want to quit?”

I responded, “Listen: The amount of paperwork I’ve had to do in the last month and a half and the number of dates I have to remember in order for a transaction to close successfully isn’t something I want to deal with. I don’t want to have the stress of forgetting dates or making sure paperwork is filled out correctly.”

**I’m just not detail-oriented.** Some of you may be detail-oriented yourselves, and you’ll have your own issues leveraging that because you won’t want to let it go. For me, however, the problem was the very opposite: I just didn’t want anything to do with paperwork.

He said to me, “Well, why don’t you hire a transaction coordinator?”

I didn’t know what those were or what they did at the time, but since, I’ve found them to be life-saving additions to any real estate team. For a couple hundred dollars per transaction, a transaction coordinator will assist with all your transactions from contract to close, including reminding you of dates and helping with paperwork.&nbsp;

I was so fired up about the prospect that I went right out and hired my first transaction coordinator. Doing so allowed me to create leverage in my business.&nbsp;

As agents, we get paid the big bucks because we have a lot of fiduciary responsibilities to our clients to make sure they’re being taken care of. **That doesn’t mean that we have to be the ones doing all the work.**

For those who aren’t detail-oriented and are stressed out by the amount of paperwork to deal with in a real estate transaction, **consider hiring a transaction coordinator.** &nbsp;I can recommend a good one for your purposes who can handle all of the back-end details of your transactions.

It helps to sit down with someone to figure out if you’re doing $15-an-hour work when you could be doing $300- to $500-an-hour work. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. Let’s go through your business and identify the areas where you can incorporate leverage to help your business grow.
