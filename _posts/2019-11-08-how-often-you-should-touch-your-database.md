How many times a year should you touch your database?

Back in the day, the number was a lot higher because communication wasn’t as fast as it is now. Things have changed quite a bit over the years, though. Not only do we use social media resources (Facebook, Instagram, etc.) all the time, but so do our clients, which means they’re bombarded all the time by other companies trying to take their business away from you.&nbsp;

The good news is, we don’t have to put a lot of thought into how many times a year we should touch our database, because Gary Keller’s book “The Millionaire Agent Mindset” actually tells you how often you should do it.&nbsp;

When the book was first published in 2002, the standard number of yearly touches was 33. Now, though, **this number has been increased to 36**—the additional three should mostly be phone calls.&nbsp;

In any case, you should start with 18 touches that should be emails or campaigns of some sort. Don’t worry about being annoying; emails aren’t annoying. If they don’t want to look at them, they’ll just delete them. If you’re a shoe shopper like I am, you probably get tons of emails from DSW. I delete most of these, but whenever I need a coupon, I know where to find one. It all comes down to what you’re sending them and what value is presented in those emails.&nbsp;

**The rest of the touches break down as follows:**

* Eight “thank you” or “thinking of you” cards
* Three phone calls
* Two birthday cards
* A Mother’s Day card
* A Father’s Day card

If this topic is a foreign concept to you, you’re in a bit of an interesting predicament. Your database is constantly getting marketed to on every social media channel, so **if you’re not touching your database enough, you’re at risk of losing business** to the big companies that are entering the real estate brokerage game. I won’t name names, but we all know who these companies are.&nbsp;
