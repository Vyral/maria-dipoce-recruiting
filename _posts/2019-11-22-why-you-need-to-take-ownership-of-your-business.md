Today’s topic is very near and dear to me. It’s something I talk to my agents about almost daily: Taking ownership of your business.

You did all this work to go out and get your license and you essentially become a business owner. **Whether you’re on a team, joined an independent brokerage, or somewhere in the middle, taking ownership of your business will make the difference between having a life worth living and one not worth living.&nbsp;**

An individual who waits on other people to get things done is typically an individual who has not quite realized that they are in control of their own business. **It’s such an empowering mindset if you think about it,** waking up and knowing that we are getting paid to make things happen. We’re not calling our brokerage asking about leads. We’re coming from an abundance mindset versus a “gimme” mindset.

**This applies to everything in your life.** If something isn’t working right in your business, it’s most likely because you really haven’t made a purposeful plan around taking ownership of that component. Right now, the big thing that everyone is going to have to wrap their minds around is technology. Facebook, Instagram, and more are great ways to touch your database but if you don’t know what you're doing, you have to take the time to get educated and learn how to create business through those platforms.&nbsp;

**I hope this message has empowered you to want to take ownership of your business.** If you want to talk more about what that looks like in your day-to-day activities, I’d love to sit down with you for a one-on-one consultation. I promise that if you take a bit more ownership of your business every day, you’ll have such a more productive and purposeful day.

If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
